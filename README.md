# 🚀 Vrexis Insights - Setup Instructions

## Overview
This is a **completely self-contained** React SaaS application for service monitoring. All styling and dependencies are packaged together, so when someone downloads it, everything works out of the box.

## 📁 File Structure
```
frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── App.js          # Main React component (REPLACE with provided code)
│   ├── App.css         # Custom Tailwind + component styles (CREATE this file)
│   ├── index.js        # Entry point (UPDATE to import App.css)
│   └── ...other files
├── package.json        # Dependencies
├── tailwind.config.js  # Tailwind configuration
└── postcss.config.js   # PostCSS configuration
```

## 🔧 Installation Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install react react-dom recharts uuid
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

### 2. Configure Tailwind CSS
Make sure your `tailwind.config.js` includes:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### 3. Configure PostCSS
Make sure your `postcss.config.js` includes:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### 4. Replace Files
- Replace `src/App.js` with the provided React component
- Create `src/App.css` with the provided CSS styles
- Update `src/index.js` to import `./App.css`

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
npm start
```

### 6. Backend Allowed Origins
When running the backend separately (for example with the desktop build), ensure
the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable allows calls from the desktop app:

```bash
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://localhost:34115,http://127.0.0.1:34115
```

## 📦 Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

The build folder will contain everything needed to deploy your SaaS application.

## 🖥 Building the Desktop App
The backend is also configured to run as a [Wails](https://wails.io) desktop
application. Use the following commands in the `backend` directory:

```bash
# Start in development mode
wails dev

# Create production binaries
wails build
```

## 🎯 Demo Data
The application includes sample service data so you can see how it works immediately. In production, you would connect this to your actual monitoring backend API.

## 🔧 Customization
All styling is in `App.css` using Tailwind's `@layer` directive, making it easy to:
- Customize colors and branding
- Add new component styles
- Modify animations and transitions
- Extend functionality
